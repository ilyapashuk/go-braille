this is a very simple table driven braille translator and backtranslator

table syntax:
lines beginning with hash sign (#) are ignored as comments
the first word of each line is ignored
the second word should contain a list of chars
the third word should contain braille dots description
example:
uplow Bb 12
means that letter B in both cases is represented as dots 1 and 2
multiple dots, like 6-12, are not supported.
words in line should be delimited by spaces, tabs are not supported.

such syntax makes this tables partially compatible with liblouis tables, but backslash escaping is not supported.
